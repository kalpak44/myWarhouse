My course work (warehouse)
==========================

It's my system for warehouse retail chain for household appliances. Products are stored in groups: model, quantities and prices.
This is a simple multithreaded server based on sockets and windows decorated as are generated in NetBens. 
I am used NetBens, Java(Swing, JDBC),MySql.

To see how this works you need:
Server:

1. Download this project 
`git clone git@github.com:kalpak44/myWarhouse.git`

2. Into the folder with the compiled server
`cd "myWarhouse/Bin Server"`

3. Start jar file
`java -jar ServerEditor.jar`

Do not forget to configure the server port and configure the database

Client:

1. Into the folder with the compiled server
`cd "myWarhouse/Bin Client"`

2. Start jar file
`java -jar ClientEditor.jar`

Do not forget to configure the server port :)
